I have many good classmates, but my best friends are Vy and Thảo. Vy
sits next to me, and Thảo sits in front of us. Both of them are very
smart and creative. Vy is good at English, and Thảo is best at maths.
They help me a lot with my study. During break time, we often play many
games together. Our favourite is hide and seek. Thảo and I like science,
so we join the school’s science club. Vy likes dancing, so she is in the
dance club. Vy often performs in front of the whole school at the
beginning of each month, and we love watching her. I think I’m very
lucky to have two best friends!

Hogwarts is a very special school: It is a school for young witches and
wizards. It is located near a lake in Scotland, but its students come
from Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales. School begins on September 1,
and students all get on a special train in London to go to school
together. Hogwarts is a boarding school, so students have classes and
live at the school. They have to wear robes as their uniform. Each
student has an owl for a pet. The owls also carry letters from families.
All students play a sport called the *quidditch*, a kind of flying
soccer. Players try to hit the ball with a stick while mounting their
flying brooms.
